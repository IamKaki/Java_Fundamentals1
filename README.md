I am on a mission to quickly learn and understand Java programming Fundamentals. I will go through them guided by the 3W Schools tutorials, pushing all the code that I practice on up here. I hope and wish for this to be a fruitful and satisfying journey. All the best to me and everyone else in the same journey.
